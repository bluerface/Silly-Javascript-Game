# Silly-Javascript-Game
FOr kill the snaks. And for the funs, to see if I could.

Beware the snaks in the dessert.  They have laid traps. 

Map created using tiler using the default assets.  Game is html, css and javascript. Appologies for using the inbuilt browser dialogue box, its easier to play if you use spacebar to dismiss it.  Dont get too addicted, my brother Jake got a score of 123 snaks! 

I have now fixed the css issues the game had previously, and as of today 29/7/16, it is working on the current releases of chrome and firefox :).
