# Silly-Javascript-Game
Made a wee browser game.  All JavaScript, no JQuery.  Used tiler to produce the map, used the default map and images.

The objective is too kill *all* the snaks.

The game was working in Chrome back when I finished it, but not in Firefox, due to blairs haxy table css.  
It would seem chrome have made an update that makes the terrible css in question break in chrome too.
Gonna just go fix that
